# What to test for
# 1. What happens in the happy path?
#   Test case 1:
#   If the input/instruction is L, the rover successfully turns Left
    describe turn_left () do
        it "If the input command is L, we turn the rover to Left " do

        end
    end


#   Test case 2:
#   If the input/instruction is R, the rover successfully turns Right


#   Test case 3:
#   If the input/instruction is M, the rover successfully moves 1 step forward


# 2. What happens when I create an error or add invalid input? (check the validation)
